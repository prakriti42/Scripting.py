# Scripting.py

Scripting.py is a repository being maintained to keep log of the python scripts that I create for automating and executing some of my boring manual task. 

#### Script I : Audio Overlayer 
This script was created as per my requirement to add some noise to the already refined audio dataset I had. Hence, with python and its near to omnipresent library, I wrote this basic code that takes in two folder paths from the user as the primary and secondary folder and iterates over the audios files in the respective folders parallely to mix them by overlaying the audio contents. After the successful audio overlaps, all the output files gets stored in a newly created directory with its path similar to that of the provided primary folder but all of it under the root directory called Output.
